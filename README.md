# Web Checkers

This was a semester project written for my Distributed Applications class. The goal was to create a working web application that would be deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance. It was written as a Java EE web application and deployed on a Payara server. The front end runs on JQuery. This project received full marks from the professor of the course.
